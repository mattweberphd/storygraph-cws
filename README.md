# storygraph-cws

Quick & dirty scraping and data analysis of StoryGraph ratings, reviews, and content warnings for white authors vs. authors of color.

Inspired by tweets from [Silvia Moreno-Garcia](https://twitter.com/silviamg/status/1404223380132274176). Any errors are mine.

## TODO

- statistical comparisons over sets of books (not just viz)
  - report written to file not stdout
- PNGs to own directory
- inputs out of code
- testing?
- Store scraped files locally for repeated analysis; manage dependencies with Luigi.
